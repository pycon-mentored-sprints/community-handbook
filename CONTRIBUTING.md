:rainbow: Welcome to the Mentored Sprints Community Handbook repository :rainbow:.

We are so excited that you want to contribute to The Community handbook :sparkles:. And we are **committed to ensuring that every user and contributor feels welcome and included in this community**.

All kind of contributions are welcome and are accepted through GitHub issues and pull requests (PR). Please read these guidelines to make sure we can integrate your contributions easily into the project.

## :raised_hands: Contributing through GitHub

To get started, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and sign-in. Here are [some instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to get you all set up.

You'll use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with formatting. For example, you could write words as bold (**bold**), or in italics (_italics_), or as a link ([link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)) to another webpage.

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Also, when writing in Markdown, please start each new sentence on a new line. While this formats in the same way as if the new line wasn't included, it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! :sparkles:.

## :pencil: Share your thoughts, bugs, requests and the such

Issues are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forward. A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

Issues are assigned [labels][labels] which explain how they relate to the overall project's goals and immediate next steps.

### :bookmark: Issue labels

The current list of labels can be found [here][labels]. You will notice that they are grouped based on their purpose, this is aimed to make it easier for you and the reviewers.

## :clapper: Make a change through a pull request (PR)

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease.

### 1. Comment on an [existing issue][issues] or open a new issue referencing your addition to the project

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] is an excellent explanation of why putting this work in upfront is so useful to everyone involved.

### 2. [Fork][link_fork] the [project's repository][repository] to your profile

This will be your unique copy of the project.
You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work, so you're super safe.

### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work all in one go, it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your pull request.

### 4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest]

We encourage you to open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible. This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on. It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking). Make sure to add the relevant labels if you need someone to have a look at your PR.

When you are ready to submit a pull request, you will automatically see the Pull Request Template contents in the pull request body. It asks you to:

- Describe the problem you're trying to fix in the pull request, reference any related issue and use fixes/close to automatically close them, if pertinent.
- List of changes proposed in the pull request.
- Describe what the reviewer should concentrate their feedback on.

If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged, add "[WIP]" at the start of the pull request title, which stands for "Work in Progress". When you are happy with it and are happy for it to be merged into the main repository, change the "[WIP]" in the title of the pull request to "[Ready for review]". Also, make sure to add the labels `PR: Draft` or `PR: MRG ready` accordingly.

**Success!!** :tada: Well done! :smiley: :tada: :sparkles:

## Thank you!

You are awesome. :purple_heart: :sparkles: :star:

And if you've found typos in this (or any other) page, you could consider submitting your very first pull request to fix them.

# About this handbook

Traditionally, when running coding sprints, you will have folks in the following roles:

- Organisers
- Attendees (a.k.a. mentees)
- Participants (a.k.a contributors)
- Mentors (mentoring projects, maintainers or the such)

This handbook is structured in such a way that it covers important aspects to be considered by each of those roles.
If you are an **organiser** you will want to read all of the sections and use or send the relevant sections as a reference to your mentors and attendees.

We have noticed, in our experience, that running online sprints have particular quirks and issues that are usually not faced at in-person events. This handbook aims to support all folks involved regardless of their level of experience or previous engagement with coding sprints.

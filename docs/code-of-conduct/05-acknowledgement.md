# 5 Acknowledgement

This code is adapted from the [Turing Way project Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html) and the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) with sections from the [Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iv2cizNPUwtEhHqaezAzjIoKkaIX02f7XbYmFMXDTGY/edit).
All of which are used under the creative commons attribution license.

The Carpentries Code of Conduct was adapted from guidelines written by the [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/), which was itself based on the [Ada Initiative template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports) and the [PyCon 2013 Procedure for Handling Harassment Incidents](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/).

The Turing Institute Data Study Group Code of Conduct was heavily adapted from the [Citizen Lab Summer Institute 2017 Code of Conduct](https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/codeofconduct.html) and used under a CC BY 2.5 CA license.
Citizen Lab based their Code of Conduct on the [xvzf Code of Conduct](http://xvzf.io/#coc), the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), the [Django Code of Conduct and Reporting Guide](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) and we are also grateful for [this guidance from Ada Initiative](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports).

We really appreciate the work that all of the communities linked above have put into creating such a well considered process.

# Mentors' Handbook

Welcome Mentored Sprints mentors! We are so grateful to have you all onboard :pray:, we would not be able to run Mentored Sprints without your help. 
We have put together a set of docs to guide and help you prepare for the Mentored Sprints.

!!!info "Getting you ready for mentoring"
    For your convenience, we have created documentation for both, in-person and online sprints:

    1. **In-person**: Mentoring and preparing yourself and your project for the sprint: [preparing as a mentor](./02-prepare.md).This section provides practical advice on how to prepare and what to do to support your mentees.
    2. **Online**: we got you covered on how to [prepare youself and your project](./02-prepare-online.md), [the technical setup and platforms used](./03-online-setup.md), and a [quick tour of our Discord](./04-discord.md).
